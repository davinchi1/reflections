When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working from different locations, different computers and when working with a team

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that you can review changes before merging them with your current work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forkes are clones done on github, clones are done online to local, and branhes are local only. Forkes and clones when copying someone's work, branches when making a copy of your own work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
This allows you to compare changes made locally, to the last update. Helps to keep a track if changes are made by contributors after.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Using Notes in the sample files, shared over the net. The merging woould be easier, since its one file, but the tracking of changes would be hard
